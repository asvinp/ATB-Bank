## [CMPE 207] - Distributed Banking System using Java and MySQL

- [x] Coded a distributed banking system consisting of customers, tellers and system admins using socket programming 
- [x] Developed the Customer interface while implementing access restrictions through MySQL database functions
- [x] Constructed an intuitive Java graphical user interface to create a user-friendly system for customers and staff while preventing any unauthorized actions

The CMPE 207 semester project is based on a distributed banking system that is based on socket programming with Customers, Tellers, and System Administrators as an audience. Each type of audience is given certain functions to interact with an imaginary bank. In addition, the bank is hierarchically structured like a pyramid with Customers on the bottom, Tellers in the middle, and System Administrators on the top. Customers are only capable of interacting within their bank account, while Tellers are capable of interacting with all Customer accounts but require confirmation from Customers. Finally, the System Administrators are in full control over Teller accounts but are unable to interact with Customer accounts in any form.
